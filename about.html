        <strong>Tech 4 Social Good Day</strong> is hosted by Tech & Society, a working group formed
        last year to help foster a community of critical inquiry at ITP and within the tech community
        in general. Through weekly meetings, reading groups, and guest speakers, we are working to
        prefigure a technological future that prioritizes ethics and justice and that better serves
        a wider societal demographic. The Tech 4 Social Good Day conference was a crazy idea to bring
        together the broader NYU tech community and its adjacents to spend a whole day and a half
        together to figure out what that might look like. We stand at a vital middle
        ground between emerging technology, civil society, and culture. We are hoping that you
        the participants will use this opportunity to meet each other, learn new skills, center
        marginalized identities, and imagine fresh ways to incorporate ethics into your work.
